### Let's Go Avs!

#### Fixes / Ideas
- animation for empty bottom section (work in progress)
- ~~animate colon between numbers to create the illusion of blinking, like an analog clock~~
- header improvements. slight animation, shadows, lighting??
- think about final state of clock containers...could add a glow to help it pop or maybe an animated border?

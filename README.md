### Go Avs!


Fixes / Ideas
- animation for empty bottom section
- keyframes to create the illusion of blinking numbers, maybe once on the hour or blink the second as it changes?
- header is really underwhelming. try to make it feel like it is part of the design, not an afterthought.
- clock number containers. think about final state of background / border. could add glow like a clock or gradient for illusion of light?
